## Technologies used :

This is a web application to manage my expenses and my incomes.

### Expenses :
I can add expenses with a name, a amount, a date and a category of expenses. I can also create recurent expenses which will happen every month.

To add a category of expenses, I used the Fetch API with JavaScript to add a category without reloading the page.

I can see all my expenses, edit them and delete them. All the sql query are made with PHP. I used object oriented programming with PHP.

## Incomes :

I can add an income, with a name, a amount, a date and I can precises if this income is recurent or not.
I can see, edit and delete any of my incomes.

## Wallet
On the home page, there is my current amount of mony and the left recurent expenses and incomes of the months. If I validate a recurent expenses, the amount of this expenses is substarct to my current amount. And if I validate a recurent income, the amount of this income is added to my current amount of money.

## History
I can also see the history of my expenses by month and by categories to see where my money is spent.

## Features to come :
I would like to keep working on these project by adding features like graph about my amount of money according to the months. What is the category where I spent the most etc.

I would also like to create a feature to help me save money.
